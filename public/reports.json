The api call isn't getting all the results so I have to figure out how to make subsequent fetches tomorrow. Wasn't as fun as I thought it would be :/",

I would like it if bigfoot sighting pins would only load if they are within 10 miles of the user but that seems like a big battle.",

Had to change the function component into a class component which wasn't all that bad. I'll try and log things i've learned, tasks I've accomplished or failed here... Probably should make this log responsive ha ha. ðŸš€",
