I fetched a local JSON with the information on it and looped over it to make this list (only 1 entry right now).  Then made it searchable by Title, Description or Tools. Had to change the function component into a class component which wasn't all that bad. I'll try and log things i've learned, tasks I've accomplished or failed here... Probably should make this log responsive ha ha. ðŸš€",
