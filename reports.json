    "description": "Worked all day long on the Bigfoot App. It was pretty frusterating because I couldn't get the state to keep up with the rendering from the API call.  I ended up just using a variable which i think is a no no but it sort of worked. Mapbox is pretty cool.  I would like it if bigfoot sighting pins would only load if they are within 10 miles of the user but that seems like a big battle.",

I fetched a local JSON with the information on it and looped over it to make this list (only 1 entry right now).  Then made it searchable by Title, Description or Tools. Had to change the function component into a class component which wasn't all that bad. I'll try and log things i've learned, tasks I've accomplished or failed here... Probably should make this log responsive ha ha. ðŸš€",
