# React Portfolio

## Description

I built this portfolio to showcase my work as a web developer. I used React to make this portfolio and utilized props and react-router to complete the app. While working on this project I learned a lot more about using CSS within a react app and creating multiple components (some that change and some that remain consistant) that combine to make a fluent user experience.

## Usage

All you have to do is go to the deployed portfolio [HERE]()
Once you land on the homepage you are able to click on any of the works to see individually deployed apps or click on their github icons to visit the repos.
